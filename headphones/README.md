# ALX HTML & CSS Projects

This repository contains my completed tasks for the ALX HTML & CSS program.  
It includes a multi-page **Headphones website** built with HTML and CSS, fully responsive for desktop and mobile.  
The project demonstrates:

- Structuring HTML content semantically  
- Styling pages with CSS  
- Creating responsive layouts  
- Using fonts, colors, images, and buttons effectively  

## How to View

Open any HTML file in your browser, for example:

- `headphones/0-index.html`  
- `headphones/7-index.html`
